# go-password-manager

This project is a CLI application which can safely store your login credentials. A variety of commands will allow you to do everything you need to do with your passwords.

This project is for me to practice developing my own CLI tool (and hopefully use it plenty myself!). I have chosen Go as I want to develop more confidence with it, and its cross-platform capabilities mean it can be used more widely.

Passwords are hashed for security, and its usage is locked behind a master password. The user will have to login with the master password before using most commands, the session will expire after 5 minutes so that no-one can access your passwords if you leave your device unattended.
